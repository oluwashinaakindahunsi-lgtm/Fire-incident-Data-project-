Project Title: Analysing Fire Incident Response Disparities in Urban and Rural Landscapes 
Project Overview: This project investigates disparities in fire incident responses across urban and rural landscapes in England, analyzing 14 years of historical data comprising over 7 million incidents. The analysis provides insights into how population density, geography, and infrastructure influence the nature, frequency, and response efficiency of fire-related emergencies. Using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, the project explores temporal trends, incident types, and regional variations to help improve resource allocation, firefighting preparedness, and community safety strategies.
Project Objectives
Identify differences in fire incident response patterns between urban and rural environments.
Analyze the distribution of incident types, volumes, and regional variations across England.
Assess the influence of population density and location on emergency response efficiency.
Provide data-driven recommendations for improving response strategies and operational planning.
Data Summary 
Data Source: UK Government Fire Statistics (2023)
Scope: 14 years of fire and rescue service data in England
Records: 7,000,000 incidents
Key Fields:
Financial Year
Fire and Rescue Service Name
Emergency Code (E-Code)
Urban/Rural Classification
Incident Type
Total Incidents
Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preparation
Power BI – Data transformation, segmentation, and visualization
SPSS – Statistical validation and pattern testing
Key Insights 
Urban areas recorded 33.9% “due to apparatus” incidents and 27.7% non-fire incidents, highlighting high infrastructure-related risks.
Rural areas experienced 28.2% non-fire and 24.2% apparatus-related incidents, reflecting broader emergency coverage needs beyond fires.
Greater London alone accounted for 33.4% of all incidents, the highest response volume nationally.
Less populated regions such as the Isles of Scilly contributed only 0.004% of total incidents, underscoring minimal fire response activity.
These insights reveal how urban firefighting demands are shaped by population density and complex infrastructure, while rural services require preventive and educational interventions.
Visualizations
The project’s Power BI dashboards illustrate:
Total incidents by type and location
Urban vs. rural and metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan distributions
Regional heatmaps showing geographical concentrations
Comparative charts showing incident frequencies and trends
These visuals supported the interpretation of disparities and helped communicate results to stakeholders clearly and interactively.
Analytical Approach
Data Preparation: Cleaned raw datasets in Excel and converted financial years into proper date formats.
Segmentation: Grouped data by geography (urban/rural), incident type, and Fire & Rescue Service.
Transformation: Created DAX measures in Power BI for incident counts and E-Code tracking.
Visualization: Built Power BI dashboards to summarize and communicate findings effectively.
Interpretation: Derived insights on regional disparities, operational pressures, and response efficiency.
Findings and Insights
Urban environments face higher apparatus-related incidents, indicating a need for technical response specialization.
Rural regions require enhanced community education and preventive measures for non-fire events.
Regional disparities (e.g., Greater London vs. rural counties) highlight the need for localized response frameworks.
Population density and urban design significantly affect incident type distribution and response demand.
Recommendations
Provide specialized equipment and training for urban firefighting teams.
Strengthen community awareness programs in rural areas to minimize non-fire emergencies.
Use data-driven monitoring to allocate Fire & Rescue Service resources efficiently.
Improve visualization techniques with interactive dashboards and percentage-based displays for clarity.
